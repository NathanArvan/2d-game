Plans:

- build out code for calculating the effects of actions (e.g. damage, healing)

- create initiative model to use with turn order and current character

- create a map that is not square, more than 4 corners

- validate actions (eg. range, targeting, etc)

- workflow / organization for actions in the action toolbar (maybe rework action states)
